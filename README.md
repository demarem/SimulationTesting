SimulationTesting
=================

simulation.py
-------------
Given a file containing all instances of models in prior, this script determines the posterior probability of both random and psuedo observed data (POD) within [2, n], where n is the number of models in the prior.

modelScorer.py
--------------
Experiement in which each model is assigned a weight.

posteriorProbability
-------------------
Determines posterior probability of both POD and highest non-POD.
